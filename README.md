#  Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

# Files Included

- `task5.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with the complete data analysis
- `Titanic_Analysis_Presentation.pptx` – PowerPoint summarizing the insights and visualizations

# Objective

The goal of this project is to explore the Titanic dataset and identify key factors that affected passenger survival, including:

- Gender
- Passenger class
- Age
- Embarkation point

# Tools & Libraries

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data handling
- **NumPy** – numerical computation
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization

# Key Analyses

- Dataset overview and summary statistics
- Missing value analysis and handling
- Distribution analysis of:
  - Survival status
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Embarkation points
- Visualizations to identify survival patterns

# Insights

- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive
- Children had better chances of survival
- Embarkation point influenced survival rates slightly

# Future Work

- Apply machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Perform feature engineering
- Evaluate performance with classification metrics

# Sample Visualization
